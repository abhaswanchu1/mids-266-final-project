\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRECITALS \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company, by resolutions duly adopted, has (i) approved this Agreement and the merger of the Company with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub surviving the merger as the surviving company (the \\u201cMerger\\u201d), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, (ii) determined that the Merger and the other transactions provided for in this Agreement on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement are fair and reasonable and advisable to, and in the best interests of, the Company, (iii) directed that the Merger be submitted for consideration at a meeting of the stockholders of the Company and (iv) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the Company vote in favor of the approval of the Merger; \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWHEREAS, the board of directors of Parent, by resolutions duly adopted, has (i) approved the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby to which it is a

pursuant to which it has agreed, among other things, to vote its Shares in favor of the Merger; and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this Agreement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n________________\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the sufficiency of which is acknowledged and agreed, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows: \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nARTICLE I \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE MERGER; CLOSING; EFFECTIVE TIME \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, the Company shall be merged with and into Merger Sub and the separate corporate existence of the Company shall thereupon cease.

The Merger shall have the effects specified in the Maryland General Corporation Law (the \\u201cMGCL\\u201d) and the Maryland REIT Law (the \\u201cMRL\\u201d). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.2 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the \\u201cClosing\\u201d) shall take place (i) remotely by the electronic exchange of documents and signatures (or their electronic counterparts), and closing deliverables, as soon as reasonably practicable, and in no event later than three (3) Business Days, following the day on which the last to be satisfied or waived of each of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VII (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) shall have been satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement or (ii) at such other place and/or on such other date as the Company and Parent may otherwise agree in writing. For purposes of this Agreement, the term \\u201cBusiness Day\\u201d shall mean any day of the year on which banks are not required or authorized by Law to close in New York City.

No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing, Parent shall enter into an agreement with the Paying Agent, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company (which confirmation of satisfaction shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), to effect the applicable terms of this Agreement.

Upon the surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such transmittal materials, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount by check after giving effect to any required Tax withholding provided in Section 4.2(f) equal to the cash amount that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 4.1(a), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be paid upon due surrender of the Certificate may be issued and/or paid to such a transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not applicable, in each case, reasonably acceptable to the Paying Agent. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term \\u201cPerson\\u201d shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity or other entity of any kind or nature.   4\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n________________\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(c) Transfers.

Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund) that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered, at Parent\\u2019s option, to Parent. Any holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this ARTICLE IV shall thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of any payment of cash (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(f)) upon due surrender of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in Section 4.2(e)), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Company, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar federal, state, local, foreign or transnational law, statute or ordinance, common law, or any rule or regulation (collectively, \\u201cLaws\\u201d). To the fullest extent permitted by Law, immediately prior to the date any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, such Merger Consideration shall become the property of the Surviving Company, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. (e) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it, the Paying Agent or the Surviving Company with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration that would have been issuable or payable pursuant to the provisions of this ARTICLE IV (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(f)) had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered. (f) Withholding Rights. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company, the Company and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \\u201cCode\\u201d), or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company, the Company or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, and timely remitted to the applicable Governmental Entity, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.   5\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n________________\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(g) Uncertificated Shares.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 6.2(e), following receipt of a written Acquisition Proposal by the Company after the date of this Agreement that did not result from a breach of this Section 6.2 and that the Company\\u2019s board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company\\u2019s board of directors may, at any time prior to the time the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, (x) make a Change in Recommendation with respect to such Superior Proposal in accordance with Section 6.2(f) (ii) and/or (y) authorize, resolve, agree or propose publicly to take any such action, if all of the following conditions are met:   48\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n________________\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(i) the Company shall have (A) provided to Parent four (4) Business Days\\u2019 prior written notice, which shall state expressly (I) that it has received a written Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal, (II) the material terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal (including the consideration offered therein and the identity of the Person or group making the Acquisition Proposal) and shall have contemporaneously provided an unredacted copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements and all other documents related to the Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any other material term or condition of such Superior Proposal shall require a new notice and an additional three (3) Business Day period) and (III) that, subject to clause (ii) below, the Company\\u2019s board of directors has determined to make a Change in Recommendation and (B) prior to making such a Change in Recommendation, (x) used commercially reasonable efforts to engage in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to engage) during such notice period, which may be on a non-exclusive basis, to consider any adjustments proposed by Parent to the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that the Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal and (y) in determining whether to make a Change in Recommendation, the board of directors of the Company shall take into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent and any other information provided by Parent in response to such notice; and (ii) the Company\\u2019s board of directors shall have determined, in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Superior Proposal and taking into account any revised terms proposed by Parent, such Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and that the failure to make such Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with the directors\\u2019 duties under applicable Law. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement before this Agreement has been validly terminated in accordance with its terms (including payment of any applicable Company Termination Fee and the Parent Expenses to the extent due and payable pursuant to Section 8.3(b)). (g) Exception to Change in Recommendation (Intervening Event). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 6.2(e), upon the occurrence of any Intervening Event, the Company\\u2019s board of directors may, at any time prior to the time the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, make a Change in Recommendation if all of the following conditions are met: (i) the Company shall have (A) provided to Parent four (4) Business Days\\u2019 prior written notice, which shall (I) set forth in reasonable detail information describing the Intervening Event and the rationale for the Change in Recommendation and (II) state expressly that, subject to clause (ii) below, the Company\\u2019s board of directors has determined to make a Change in Recommendation and (B) prior to making such a Change in Recommendation, used commercially reasonable efforts to engage in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent   49\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n________________\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwishes to engage) during such four (4) -Business Day period to consider any adjustments proposed by Parent to the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that the failure of the Company\\u2019s board of directors to make a Change in Recommendation in response to the Intervening Event in accordance with clause (ii) below would no longer be inconsistent with the directors\\u2019 duties under applicable Law; and (ii) the Company\\u2019s board of directors shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that in light of such Intervening Event and taking into account any revised terms proposed by Parent, the failure to make a Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with the directors\\u2019 duties under applicable Law. (h) Certain Permitted Disclosure. Nothing contained in this Section 6.2 shall be deemed to prohibit the Company from complying with its disclosure obligations under applicable U.S. federal Law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal; provided, that (i) this Section 6.2(h) shall not be deemed to permit the Company or the Company\\u2019s board of directors to make a Change in Recommendation except in accordance with Section 6.2(g) and (ii) any communication related to an Acquisition Proposal shall expressly state that the Company\\u2019s board of directors has not changed the Company Recommendation. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n6.3 Information Supplied. (a) The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event, within twenty (20) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, prepare and file with the SEC a proxy statement on Schedule 14A (such proxy statement, including any amendment or supplement thereto, the \\u201cProxy Statement\\u201d) in preliminary form relating to the Company Stockholders Meeting. The Company and Parent shall each use their reasonable best efforts to provide responses to the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in any event within ten (10) days of the date of any SEC comment letter) with respect to any comments received on the Proxy Statement by the SEC and the Company shall cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date the SEC or the Staff advises that it has no further comments thereon or that the Company may commence mailing the Proxy Statement. (b) No filing of, or amendment, or supplement to, the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company without providing Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon (other than any filing, amendment or supplement in connection with a Change in Recommendation). The Company shall promptly provide Parent with copies of all such filings, amendments or supplements to the extent not readily publicly available. Parent shall (i) furnish to the Company all information required by the Exchange Act or applicable Law to be included in the Proxy Statement concerning it and the other Parent Parties, (ii) provide such other assistance as may be reasonably requested by the Company in connection with the preparation of information to be included therein and (iii) otherwise reasonably assist and cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement and the resolution of any comments received from the SEC. If at any time prior to the receipt of the Requisite Company Vote, any information relating to the Company or any of its Affiliates, directors or officers or Parent, or any of its partners or managers or any other Parent Party, is discovered by the Company or Parent which is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement   50\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n________________\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsuch that the Proxy Statement would not (A) include any misstatement of a material fact or (B) omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, then (x) the party that makes such discovery shall promptly notify the other party and (y) the Company shall prepare (with Parent\\u2019s reasonable assistance) and file with the SEC an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminate such amendment or supplement to the stockholders of the Company. The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC (the \\u201cStaff\\u201d) and of any request by the SEC or the Staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the Staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Merger. No response to any comments from the SEC or the Staff relating to the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company without providing Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, unless made pursuant to a telephone call initiated by the SEC. The Company will cause the Proxy Statement to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n6.4 Company Stockholders Meeting. (a) The Company will, in coordination with Parent, as promptly as reasonably practicable in accordance with applicable Law and the Company Charter and Company Bylaws, establish a record date for, duly call and give notice of, and use its reasonable best efforts to convene a meeting of holders of Shares to consider and vote upon the approval of the Merger (the \\u201cCompany Stockholders Meeting\\u201d). Unless the board of directors of the Company determines that it would be inconsistent with the directors\\u2019 duties under applicable Law, the Company Stockholders Meeting shall in any event be no less than thirty-five (35) calendar days and no later than forty (40) calendar days after (1) the tenth calendar day after the initial preliminary Proxy Statement therefor has been filed with the SEC if by such date the SEC has not informed the Company that it intends to review the Proxy Statement or (2) if the SEC has, by the tenth calendar day after the initial preliminary Proxy Statement therefor has been filed with the SEC, informed the Company that it intends to review the Proxy Statement, the date on which the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement. Subject to the provisions of Section 6.2, the Company\\u2019s board of directors shall (i) include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (ii) recommend at the Company Stockholders Meeting that the holders of Shares approve the Merger and (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and solicit such approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if on or before the date on which the Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, the Company reasonably believes that (A) it will not receive proxies representing the Requisite Company Vote, whether or not a quorum is present or (B) it will not have enough Shares represented to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company may postpone or adjourn, or make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of, the Company Stockholders Meeting in consultation with Parent. In addition, notwithstanding the first and second sentence of this Section 6.4(a), the Company may postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting to allow reasonable additional time for the filing or mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure that the Company has determined, after consultation with outside legal counsel, is reasonably likely to be required under applicable Law and for such   51\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n________________\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsupplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated in a manner suitable under applicable Law and reviewed by stockholders of the Company prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting. Furthermore, notwithstanding the first and second sentence of this Section 6.4(a), solely in the event Parent determines in good faith after consultation with the Company that the Company would not reasonably be expected to receive proxies representing the Requisite Company Vote, then upon the written request of Parent, the Company shall adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting in order to solicit additional proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, in which case, the Company shall, unless the board of directors of the Company has effected a Change in Recommendation in compliance with Section 6.2(f), use its reasonable best efforts during any such adjournment to solicit and obtain such proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement as soon as reasonably practicable; provided, that Parent shall only be entitled to request such an adjournment twice and, in any event, for no more than seven (7) days in each instance. Without the prior written consent of Parent, the approval of the Merger shall be the only matter (other than matters of procedure and matters required by applicable Law to be voted on by the Company\\u2019s stockholders in connection with the approval of the Merger) that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders Meeting. The Company shall cooperate with and keep Parent informed on a reasonably current basis regarding its solicitation efforts and voting results following dissemination of the definitive Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the record date of the Company Stockholders Meeting be changed without the Parent\\u2019s prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless required by applicable Law. (b) Notwithstanding any Change in Recommendation, the Company shall nonetheless submit the Merger to the holders of Shares for approval at the Company Stockholders Meeting unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with ARTICLE VIII prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting. (c) The Company agrees that, except in the event of a Change in Recommendation, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies to obtain the Requisite Company Vote. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n6.5 Filings; Other Actions; Notification and Cooperation. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein, (i) the Company shall use, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to use, their respective reasonable best efforts to take (or cause to be taken) all actions, and do (or cause to be done) all things necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as expeditiously as possible, and in no event later than the Termination Date including (A) preparing and filing all documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings and to obtain as expeditiously as possible all consents, registrations, approvals, permits, expirations of waiting periods and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) satisfying the conditions to the obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger, (C) defending any Proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger, (D) obtaining   52\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n________________\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nany consent, approval of, or waiver or exemption by, any non-governmental third party required to be obtained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (the \\u201cCompany Third Party Consents\\u201d), including obtaining from the applicable agents, trustees and/or lenders a consent to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (in each case, to the extent necessary, proper or advisable to be obtained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger) and the Specified Lender Consent (as such term is defined in Section 6.1(a)(xiii) of the Company Disclosure Letter), (E) maintaining in full force and effect (once effective) the Company Third Party Consents, including the Existing Lender Consents and the Specified Lender Consent and satisfying any conditions applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under the Existing Lender Consents and the Specified Lender Consent, (F) executing and delivering any reasonable additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement, and (G) cooperating with Parent and Merger Sub in connection with Parent\\u2019s obligations set forth in clause (ii) below, and (ii) Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to take (or cause to be taken) all actions, and do (or cause to be done) all things necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as expeditiously as possible, and in no event later than the Termination Date including (A) preparing and filing all documentation to effect all notices, reports and other filings necessary or advisable to be made by them and to obtain as expeditiously as possible all consents, registrations, approvals, permits, expirations of waiting periods and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained by them from any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) satisfying the conditions to the Company\\u2019s obligation to consummate the Merger, (C) cooperating with the Company to defend any Proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger, (D) obtaining any consent, approval of, or waiver or exemption by, any non-governmental third party required to be obtained by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, (E) executing and delivering any reasonable additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement, and (F) cooperating with the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with their obligations set forth in clause (i) above (including, in each of (A) through (F) of this clause (ii), for the avoidance of doubt, in connection with maintaining in full force and effect the Existing Lender Consents (including, delivery or causing the delivery of any acknowledgments, reaffirmations and legal opinions required pursuant thereto) and obtaining the Specified Lender Consent); provided, however, that nothing in this Section 6.5 or any other provision of this Agreement shall require Parent or Merger Sub to agree to any Burdensome Condition (as defined in Section 6.1(a)(xiii) of the Company Disclosure Letter). (b) Subject to Section 6.5(c), in the event that the parties receive a request for information or documentary material pursuant to any Antitrust Laws, unless otherwise agreed to by the Company and Parent, the parties will use their reasonable best efforts to submit an appropriate response to, and to certify compliance with, such request as promptly as practicable and advisable, and counsel for both parties will closely cooperate during the entirety of any review process in connection therewith. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor Parent or Merger Sub, shall knowingly take, cause or permit to be taken, or omit to take, any action which such party reasonably expects is likely to materially delay or prevent   53\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n________________\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nconsummation of the contemplated transactions, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. None of the parties, without the other party\\u2019s prior written consent, shall enter into any timing or similar agreement, or otherwise agree or commit to any arrangement, that would bind or commit the parties not to consummate the contemplated transactions (or that would otherwise prevent or prohibit the parties from consummating the contemplated transactions). As used in this Agreement, the term \\u201cAntitrust Laws\\u201d means the Sherman Act, the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914 and all other federal, state and foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees and other Laws and Orders that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or competition. (c) Parent and the Company shall cooperate with respect to the Antitrust Laws and shall have joint decision making authority with respect to the appropriate course of action with respect to obtaining the consents, approvals, permits, waiting period expirations or authorizations of any Governmental Entity required to consummate the Merger prior to the Termination Date. No party hereto or its counsel shall independently participate in any substantive call or meeting relating to the Antitrust Laws with any Governmental Entity in respect of such filings, investigation, or other inquiry without first giving the other party or its counsel prior notice of such call or meeting and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend and participate. In furtherance of the foregoing and to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (i) each party shall notify the other, as far in advance as practicable, of any filing or material or substantive communication or inquiry it or any of its Subsidiaries intends to make with any Governmental Entity relating to the matters that are the subject of this Section 6.5, (ii) prior to submitting any such filing or making any such communication or inquiry, such party shall provide the other party and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review, and shall consider in good faith the comments of the other party in connection with, any such filing, communication or inquiry, (iii) promptly following the submission of such filing or making such communication or inquiry, provide the other party with a copy of any such filing or, if in written form, communication or inquiry and (iv) consult with the other party in connection with any inquiry, hearing, investigation or litigation by, or negotiations with, any Governmental Entity relating to the Merger, including the scheduling of, and strategic planning for, any meetings with any Governmental Entity relating thereto. In exercising the foregoing cooperation rights, the Company and Parent each shall act reasonably and as promptly as reasonably practicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, materials provided pursuant to this Section 6.5 may be reasonably redacted as necessary to address reasonable privilege concerns and information relating to valuation. (d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in this Section 6.5, each of the parties hereto shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, use their respective reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Entity in connection with any applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and to avoid the entry of, or effect the dissolution of, any decree, order, judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding, that would otherwise have the effect of preventing the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.   54\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n________________\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in this Section 6.5, if any Proceeding, including any Proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, each of the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such Proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger. (f) Information. (i) The Company shall, upon request by the Parent, promptly furnish the Parent with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and its Affiliates and (ii) Parent shall, upon request by the Company and/or any third party or Governmental Entity with which a filing, notice or application has been made or from which a consent has been sought, promptly furnish the Company and such third party or Governmental Entity (if applicable) with all information concerning itself, its directors and officers, the Equity Investors and any direct or indirect legal or beneficial holder of equity interests in any Equity Investor, in each case as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application made, or consent sought, by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, in connection with obtaining the Specified Lender Consent). (g) Status. The Company and Parent each shall keep the other reasonably apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other communications received by the Company or Parent, as the case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries from any third party or any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than immaterial communications. (h) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.5 or elsewhere in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Parent or Merger Sub be required to (and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, or shall offer or agree to, do any of the following without Parent\\u2019s prior written consent) in connection with obtaining any necessary approvals or consents under any applicable Antitrust Laws: (i) propose, negotiate, commit to or effect (or cause any Parent Party to propose, negotiate, commit to or effect), by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, disposition, or license of any assets, properties, products, rights, services or businesses of any of the Parent Parties, or any interest therein, or agree to any other structural or conduct remedy applicable to any of the foregoing, (ii) otherwise take or commit to take any actions that would limit any of the Parent Parties\\u2019 freedom of action with respect to, or its or their ability to retain, any assets, properties, products, rights, services or businesses of any of such Parent Parties or any interest therein; or (iii) agree to do any of the foregoing; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing clauses (i)-(iii) do not include or extend to the provision of, or restrictions under, guarantees to the extent such guarantees are expressly required by the terms of any Existing Lender Consents and/or the Specified Lender Consent.   55\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n________________\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n6.6 Access; Consultation. (a) Upon reasonable notice, and except as may otherwise be required by applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, and shall direct its and their Representatives and the Manager to, afford Parent and its Representatives reasonable access (taking into account COVID-19), during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to the Company\\u2019s and its Subsidiaries\\u2019 employees, customers, suppliers, properties, assets, commitments, Tax Returns, books, records and Contracts and to the Prospective Employees (as such term is defined in the Termination Agreement) and the books and records of the Manager that relate to the Company and its Subsidiaries (to the extent such books and records are accessible or reasonably obtainable by the Company), and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, furnish as promptly as reasonably practicable, to Parent and its Representatives all information in the possession of the Company or its Subsidiaries or that may be obtained by the Company, in each case, concerning its or any of its Subsidiaries\\u2019 capital stock, business and personnel or the Prospective Employees as may reasonably be requested by Parent in connection with the Merger; provided, that no investigation pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the Company or Parent; and provided, further, that the foregoing shall not require the Company to (i) permit any invasive environmental sampling or (ii) disclose any information pursuant to this Section 6.6, in the case of clause (ii), to the extent that in the reasonable good faith judgment of the Company\\u2019s outside legal counsel, (A) any applicable Law requires the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any such properties or information, (B) the information is subject to confidentiality obligations to a third party or (C) disclosure of any such information or document would result in the loss of attorney-client privilege; provided, further, that with respect to clauses (A) through (C) of this Section 6.6(a), the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (I) obtain the required consent of any such third party to provide such inspection or disclosure, (II) develop an alternative to providing such information so as to address such matters that is reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company and (III) in the case of clauses (A) and (C) of this Section 6.6(a), implement appropriate and mutually agreeable measures to permit the disclosure of such information in a manner to remove the basis for the objection, including by arrangement of appropriate clean room procedures, redaction (solely to the extent necessary) or entry into a customary joint defense agreement with respect to any information to be so provided, if the parties determine that doing so would reasonably permit the disclosure of such information without violating applicable Law or jeopardizing such privilege. Any investigation pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the other party. All requests for information made pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall be directed to an executive officer of the Company or such Person as may be designated by any such executive officer. No investigation pursuant to this Section 6.6 or information provided, made available or delivered to Parent pursuant to this Agreement shall affect any of the representations, warranties, rights or remedies of the parties hereunder.

Such material and the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside counsel of the recipient, or otherwise as the restriction indicates, and shall be subject to any additional confidentiality or joint defense agreement between the parties. All information exchanged pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement.

All such information that is entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege shall remain entitled to such protection under these privileges, this Agreement, and under the joint defense doctrine. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall reasonably cooperate in identifying any actions or practices of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that could require remediation under applicable Law and, to the extent identified, shall cooperate in taking commercially reasonable actions or practices and other customary actions to reduce the risks related to such actions where the failure to remediate would reasonably be likely to result in substantial fines or penalties. (c) Each of the Company and Parent shall give prompt written notice to one another of (i) any change, event, occurrence, development, circumstance or condition that would reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect (as applicable), (ii) any reasonably likely failure of any condition to Parent\\u2019s or the Company\\u2019s obligations to effect the Merger (as applicable) and (iii) any written notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement or the Merger or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n6.7 Stock Exchange De-listing and De-registration.

Without limitation of the foregoing, the parties hereby further acknowledge and agree that prior to the Closing, the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of, and to prevent or cure breaches of the covenants required to be performed by Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement (including Section 6.5, and including to cause Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the Closing and to make the payments contemplated by this Agreement, including ARTICLE I and ARTICLE IV) in addition to any other remedy to which the Company is entitled at law or in equity, including the Company\\u2019s right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to ARTICLE VIII and seek money damages in accordance therewith.
